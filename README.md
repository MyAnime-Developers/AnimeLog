## Overview

### Description

AnimeLog is an app where users can track the anime shows they're watching, as well as view the general information about a show, including the overview, voice actors, etc.

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Entertainment
- **Mobile:** Inspired by my anime list website. Going to have descriptions based on voice actors, clips/ss of anime shows, reviews of anime viewers. When adding an anime to your list, it will include an audio sound jingle and a toast will be displayed.
- **Story:** Anime fans can keep track of various anime shows being released or already released anime shows. 
- **Market:** Geared towards Anime fans whether hardcore or casual anime watchers.
- **Habit:** Depending on each person it won't be a daily thing, but we expect users to use it weekly. 
- **Scope:** Should be somewhat similar to the MyFlixr movie review app we completed in the past, but incorporating anime reviews and anime related content.
