Top 5 App Evaluations:


1. Black History Trivia 


**Mobile**: 
- Audio: If the user answers the question correctly, a sound will play... more audio features will be incorporated into the app
- Location: sprinkle in some Black history questions related to the user's location.
- Camera: a user can create a profile and use their camera to take a picture of themselves  for that profile.
     
**Category**: Educational Game

**Story**: 
- Seeing as Black History is not widely taught in schools, this app will allow for students and peers around me to learn more about it. 
    
**Market**:
- This app is marketed towards everyone, but we do expect a high percentage of Black people to engage with the app. 
    
**Habit**:
- Incorporate a daily question, which leads to more points or free prize the user can use. Incorporate a point system / leadership board.

**Scope**:
- This project will be completed by the end of the program because we have several references we can use (Past projects, videos, Google, etc).

2. Letterboxd inspired App:

**Mobile**: 
- It will be inspired by Letterboxd, so it will have similar features. Possibly may include the ability to see movies playing at local theaters.

**Category**: Entertainment

**Story**:
- App is valuable because movies are a worldwide experience and anyone can use the app to write  and see reviews on various movies.

**Market**:
- Audience for the app is the general public, although cinephiles might use the app more often than other people.

**Habit**:
- App is generally non-addicting, but it's possible that a point system for writing and reading reviews for rewards might make users frequent the app more.

**Scope**:
- We can refer to the flixster app for help, as well as online resources to complete the app.

3. Vacation finder app:


**Mobile**:
- An app to research vacation spots to potentially visit and see the history/tourist attractions of that place. May also include weather, population, etc. 

**Category**: Travel/educational

**Story**:
- People that like to travel and learn about the history of various places. Friends and peers would react positively to this app because it allows them to find these spots in a more convenient way. 

**Market**:
- Everyone can use this app. Geared more towards travelers rather than the average person, but generally marketed towards everyone. 

**Habit**:
- Review-like app, users can add their own reviews and provide input. Not an app a user would use daily, but can be used to help other people make more informed decisions as to where they want to travel. 

**Scope**:
- Use a vacation API though the difficulty depends on whether we can find that API. Review implementation shouldn't be too difficult either.

4. Shazam inspired App


**Mobile**: Inspired by the already made Shazam app. Might incorporate audio, lyrics of songs, inputting a list of albums by the artist the user is currently listening to. 

**Category**: Music

**Story**: People who enjoy listening to music, want to dive more into an artist's discography, trying to find the title of a song.

**Market**: Geared towards everyone, target audience is people who really like to listen to music.

**Habit**: People can use it frequently

**Scope**: All depends on whether we can find an API for the app

5. MyAnimeList inspired app


**Mobile**: Inspired by my anime list website. Going to have descriptions based on voice actors, clips/ss of anime shows, reviews of anime viewers. 

**Category**: Entertainment

**Story**: Anime fans can keep track of various anime shows being released or already released anime shows. 

**Market**: Geared towards Anime fans whether hardcore or casual anime watchers. 

**Habit**: Depending on each person it won't be a daily thing, but we expect users to use it weekly. 

**Scope**: Should be somewhat similar to the MyFlixr movie review app we completed in the past, but incorporating anime reviews and anime related content.
